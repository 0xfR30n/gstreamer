GStreamer: Release notes for GStreamer 0.8.10 "No Fun"
        

The GStreamer team is happy to announce a new release
in the 0.8.x stable series of the GStreamer streaming media framework.


The 0.8.x series is a stable series aimed at end users.
It is not API or ABI compatible with the stable 0.6.x series.
It is, however, parallel installable with the 0.6.x series.


This module only contains core functionality.  For actual media playback,
you will need other modules.  GStreamer Plugins contains a huge set of
additional plugins.  GStreamer FFmpeg contains a plugin based on the popular
FFmpeg decoding library.  These modules need not have the same source version
as the core, as long as they are in the 0.8.x series.

      * Fixes for 64-bit platforms

Support and Bugs

We use GNOME's bugzilla for bug reports and feature requests:

Developers

CVS is hosted on cvs.freedesktop.org.
All code is in CVS and can be checked out from there.
Interested developers of the core library, plug-ins, and applications should
subscribe to the gstreamer-devel list. If there is sufficient interest we
will create more lists as necessary.

        
Applications

Applications already ported to use GStreamer 0.8.x include the GNOME
desktop components like gnome-media and nautilus-media, as well as other
GNOME applications including sound-juicer, totem and rhythmbox.


Users of Flumotion on 64-bit systems need to upgrade to this release, as it
contains an important bug fix needed for the TCP elements.


Users of Totem and Rhythmbox (development) having small pauses when playing
MP3 files should also upgrade, as this is fixed in the queue element.
