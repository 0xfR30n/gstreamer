GStreamer: Release notes for GStreamer 0.8.10 "So Long ..."
        

The GStreamer team is happy to announce a new release
in the 0.8.x stable series of the GStreamer streaming media framework.


The 0.8.x series is a stable series aimed at end users.
It is not API or ABI compatible with the stable 0.6.x series.
It is, however, parallel installable with the 0.6.x series.


This module only contains core functionality.  For actual media playback,
you will need other modules.  GStreamer Plugins contains a huge set of
additional plugins.  GStreamer FFmpeg contains a plugin based on the popular
FFmpeg decoding library.  These modules need not have the same source version
as the core, as long as they are in the 0.8.x series.


A special "thank you" to Ronald Bultje, who has done most of the work on 0.8
in the past year.  We wish him luck on his new adventure in NYC.  Thanks for
all the fix !
