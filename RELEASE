GStreamer: Release notes for GStreamer FFmpeg 0.8.7 "Redneck soup"
        

The GStreamer team is happy to announce a new stable release of the
FFmpeg-based GStreamer plugin.


This module is separated from GStreamer Plugins for easier maintenance
and decoupled release cycles.
Our CVS contains both the patched source code to FFmpeg, as well as the
set of patches against upstream CVS, so we can send patches upstream
regularly from our modifications.
