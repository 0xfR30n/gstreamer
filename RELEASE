                   GStreamer "Toes Wide Open" 0.4.2 released

   The  GStreamer  team  is  happy  to  announce  another  release of the
   GStreamer  streaming-media  framework. This release has mainly focused
   on  code  clean-up  and  rounding out of the features. Large chunks of
   GStreamer are API stable at this point.

   Our development currently focus on the following items:
     * Increase stability and portability of scheduler
     * Add more video editing specific plugins
     * Improve plugins currently used by existing applications
     * Create language bindings

   We are starting to have a really nice collection of applications under
   development using GStreamer. If you are looking for something specific
   check out our [1]applications status page.

Known Issues

   GStreamer  currently  ships  with  schedulers  based  on  two cothread
   packages.  The  'omega'  cothread  package  is  the  one  we have been
   shipping for a long time now and is still the default in this release.
   There  are  however  some  limitations  and thread-related bugs in the
   omega  scheduler.  These  limitations  are  not present in the 'wingo'
   schedulers, but unfortunately it does not work with i686 glibc at this
   time  due  to  differences  in the way threads are handled compared to
   other  architectures,  including  i386.  A new (third) scheduler (that
   doesn't use cothreads) is being developed.

   As  for  the  bugs  in  the  'omega'  schedulers, we did not feel they
   warranted not releasing 0.4.2 as they are rather obscure. For instance
   if  you are using Rhythmbox you will need to be playing over 500 songs
   nonstop to trigger it. You can choose a different scheduler by passing
   --scheduler=(name) to any GStreamer application.

   Wim  Taymans  has  started  work on a new scheduler. The first part is
   already in CVS, but it will probably still be some months before it is
   ready.

Support and Bugs

   We  use  [4]Gnome's Bugzilla for bug reports and feature requests. The
   "product  name"  is  GStreamer  (capital  G).  Please do the following
   before writing a bug report :
gst-feedback &> feedback 2>&1

   and  attach  the  file  "feedback" to your bug report, so that we have
   some information useful in the debugging process.

Developers

   GStreamer  is  [5]hosted on SourceForge. All code is in CVS and can be
   checked  out  from  there.  Interested developers of the core library,
   plug-ins,  and  applications  should  subscribe to the gstreamer-devel
   list.  If  there  is  sufficient interest we will create more lists as
   necessary.

   We  are  still  looking for people with access to Solaris, HP-UX, Irix
   and  True64  that  would  be  willing  to  try  building  and  testing
   GStreamer. Patches fixing such problems are also more than welcome.
